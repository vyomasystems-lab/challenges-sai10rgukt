# Final Report - Sai
## Leve1 Design 1-Multiplexer
 In the given verilog code for Multiplexer there wasn't inp30 assignment. 
 That is ,there is no such case for output display of inp30 , it is bug in the given code
 So,i indentified the bug by giving some value to inp30 and selecting 30 line and make a call for the output ,if out doesn't display the given assigned value to inp30,then it seems there is problem in the circuit.

 By these way bug is found out in the given code.
